- This portfolio demonstrates the use of SQL views, stored procedures, and stored functions to manage and manipulate database data. It covers tasks such as filtering data with views, updating records with stored procedures, and retrieving data using functions.

## Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Setup MySQL Workbench:**

   * Open XAMPP and start the MySQL server.
   * Connect MySQL Workbench to the server.
   * Execute practice queries using the `democodes.sql` file.

2. **Use Inventory Database:**

   * Open the `inventory.sql` file to begin the tasks.

3. **Create Views:**

   * Create a view to display vendor information and products with in-date from 2002 onward.
   * Create a view for products with prices between 100-150.
   * Create a view to compute the total price for products sold by specific vendors.

4. **Create Stored Procedure:**

   * Create a stored procedure that updates the vendor name from 'Bryson, Inc.' to 'Bryson and Co'.

5. **Create Function:**

   * Create a function that takes vendor code and state as parameters to display product details.

6. **Execute and Document:**

   * Execute the SQL statements and capture screenshots of the commands and outputs.
